Graph vs Tree


The primary difference is that trees are top/down hierarchical structures

Trees are in fact a type of Graph


Unlike trees, graphs can have cycles, multiple edges between the same pair of nodes and nodes WITHOUT a parent-child relationship.

Graphs are usually implemented to represented Interconnected relationships like a friend/follow network on a social media site.


Tree = always has n-1 edges if there are n nodes, which ensures there are no cycles and the graph is connected!

Graphs = can have any number of edges, and its connectivity is NOT guaranteed


* Graph Traversal:
DFS = involves checking for previously visited nodes to AVOID infinite loops due to cycles

BFS = more useful for finding the SHORTEST PATH in UNWEIGHTED graphs


! Graph DFS:
* Cycle handling
in graphs, the main difference lies in handling cycles by maintaining a 'visited' set to track which nodes have been explored. This is critical to avoid an infinite loop

In trees the base case is there are no more nodes to traverse. node.left and node.right return NULL

In Graphs, especially bidirectional ones, one could keep traversing indefinitely.

Trees, typically being less dense and structured in a hierarchical manner, less frequently encounter deep recursion issues.

Union by Rank and Path Compression optimizations, is a key data structure used primarily for handling the union and find operations on DISJOINT SETS.

! UnionFind Operations:
* Find:
determines which subset a particular element is in. This can be used to determine if two elements are in the SAME subset.

* Union:
JOIN two subsets into a single subset

! Union by Rank:
* Rank:
This is roughly the DEPTH of the tree representing the set. Instead of blindly appending one set to another during the UNION/COMBINE operation, we attach the "shorter" tree under the "taller" tree. This prevents the tree structure from becoming too skewed, keeping operations closer to constant time.
 
* Path Compression:
During the find operation, we make the tree FLATTER by making every node POINT directly to the root. This drastically reduces the PATH LENGTH for future operations.
