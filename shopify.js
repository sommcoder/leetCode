/*
 
You are in a maze with 4 rooms, each with gold inside. Room A has 40 gold, B has 50, C has 75, and D has 100.

Each room is connected via a Path that costs a certain amount of gold to use. To determine how much gold you need to pay, complete that Pathâ€™s math equation and deduct its result (rounding up) from your total gold.

The Path equations are as follows:

Pathway AB: 2 + 3 * 4 - 5 / 10 + 5^2

Pathway AC: 2^3 + 4 * 5 - 6 /10 + 1

Pathway BC: 5 * 4 - 2 + 5^2 - 7

Pathway BD: 3 + 4 * 5 - 8 / 2 + 1

Pathway CD: 3^3 + 8 - 5 * 3 + 8

Your total gold cannot be reduced below zero, gold can only be gained once per room, and Paths can be used from either direction. Assuming you start in room A and exit in room D, determine the optimal route through the rooms to exit with the most treasure possible.

Your final answer must be the order of the rooms visited ie: ABC, ABD, etc.
